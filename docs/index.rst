PhysicsNeMo Sym
===============

NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo Sym is a deep learning framework that blends the power of 
physics and partial differential equations (PDEs) with AI to build more 
robust models for better analysis. 

There is a plethora of ways in which ML/NN models can be applied for 
physics-based systems. These can depend based on the availability of 
observational data and the extent of understanding of underlying physics. 
Based on these aspects, the ML/NN based methodologies can be broadly 
classified into forward (physics-driven), data-driven and hybrid approaches 
that involve both the physics and data assimilation.
